# Challenge writeups

This repository serves as my collection of solutions and thought process, while solving several *CTF* challenges. I use it to learn and study new security concepts. Since I use *CTF* challenges to learn, the writeups may include more than the step-by-step solution. In other words, the writeups may include theoretical knowledge that I later applied to solve the challenge.

The writeups are organized by platforms/competitions and topic.
